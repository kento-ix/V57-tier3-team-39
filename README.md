# 🧭 Overview
PRTrackr is a web application designed to help development teams efficiently track, review, and manage their GitHub Pull Requests (PRs).
While GitHub already provides basic PR tracking, PRTrackr enhances this experience by offering a more visual, interactive, and informative dashboard — enabling teams to quickly see which PRs are waiting for review, who is responsible, and what has already been completed.

The app integrates directly with the GitHub REST API to retrieve both open and closed PR data, presenting it in an easy-to-understand format that supports filtering, sorting, and historical insight.
This tool empowers teams to collaborate more efficiently and minimize workflow bottlenecks caused by delayed PR reviews.
